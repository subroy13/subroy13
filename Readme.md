Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a statistician going by my academic career and a Principal Information Researcher going by the industry standard. I am passionate about the applications of statistics, machine learning and deep learning in our daily lives. Here you'll find some of my personal projects, contributions, and maybe a few random experiments.

Also visit my website [statwizard.in](https://www.statwizard.in/), you'll find some blog posts about certain projects there.
